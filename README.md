I’m a Full-Stack Software Engineer with a strong focus on building practical, scalable solutions.
I use AI as a development tool to improve productivity, automate workflows, and enhance system design.

I’m also deeply involved in blockchain development, working with:

Ethereum (Solidity)

Starknet (Cairo)

I enjoy building secure, efficient applications that combine modern web technologies with decentralized systems.
